# TalkJS's OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains an OpenAPI specification for [TalkJS’s REST API](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/REST_API/Getting_Started/Introduction/).

Specification files can be found in the `json` and `yaml` directories. Currently the spec is only available for the most recent API version (2024-01-01).

## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface document for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface documentation [has] done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.
